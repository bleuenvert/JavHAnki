This is a basic implementation of a flash card program.
The name is a very lazy mash up of:
Java - the computer language it is written in.
Hangugeo - the natural language I intend to be studied in this program.
Anki - the flashcard program I currently use and of whose feature list I have drawn inspiration.

A main menu that allows the user to select between 3 sub menus that allow:
	- studying from previously added cards
	- adding new cards
	- view data on cards
	
Studying cards:
	- By default quiz front and back.
	- On question scene have mutliple buttons (see next card, correct answer, incorrect answer)
	
	
Add cards:
	- front and back
	- allow for multiple decks
	- deck class & card class where decks are collections of card objects
	- all data saved to files in a deck and data folder
	

Data:
	- select a deck to see info
	- number of times studied
	- correct percentage over all study sessions
